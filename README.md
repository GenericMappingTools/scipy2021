following is required:

> A short bio of the presenter or team members, containing a description of
  past experiences as a trainer/teacher/speaker, and (ideally) links to videos
  of these experiences if available.

Liam (he/him/his) is a PhD student studying seismology and infrasound at the
University of Alaska Fairbanks Geophysical Institute in Fairbanks, Alaska, USA.
He is a contributor to PyGMT and, in summer 2020, taught a module on PyGMT for
the inaugural
[Remote Online Sessions for Emerging Seismologists (ROSES)](https://www.iris.edu/hq/inclass/course/roses)
summer school. The materials for the ROSES module can be found in
[this GitHub repository](https://github.com/fdannemanndugick/roses2020), and a
1-hour-long video recording of part of the course can be viewed on YouTube
[here](https://youtu.be/SSIGJEe0BIk).

> A list of prerequisite skills expected of attendees, so that participants can
  choose level appropriate tutorials.

> A description of the tutorial, suitable for posting on the SciPy website for
  attendees to view. It should include the target audience, the expected level
  of knowledge prior to the class, and the goals of the class.

> A more detailed outline of the tutorial content, including the duration of
  each part and exercise sessions. Please include a description of how you plan
  to make the tutorial hands-on.

> Detailed installation instructions for various common Python environments so
  that attendees can have everything ready for participating before heading to
  SciPy.

> If available, the tutorial notes, slides, exercise files, and IPython
  notebooks, even if they are preliminary.
